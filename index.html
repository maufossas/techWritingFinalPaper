            <p>Hemoglobin is the iron-containing oxygen-transport protein in the red blood cells (Farid, 2019). Hemoglobin in blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body where it releases the oxygen to permit aerobic respiration and carries carbon dioxide — a byproduct of metabolism — back to the lungs to be excreted. Hemoglobin is a tetramer, meaning it consists of 4 protein subunits called the globin molecules. In humans there are 3 types of hemoglobin: HbA which is formed by 2 alpha and 2 beta globins and constitutes 95% to 98% of total hemoglobin in healthy adults, HbA2 which is formed by 2 alpha and 2 delta globins and constitutes 2-3% of total hemoglobin in healthy adults, and HbF or fetal hemoglobin which is formed by 2 alpha and 2 gamma globins and is the main type of hemoglobin found in fetuses and newborns with trace amounts found in healthy adults. </p>

            <span>As noted previously and as shown in figure 2, the production of α-globin is controlled by the four alleles of HBA1 and HBA2 and changes in these genes cause α-thalassemia. Someone having 4 functional alpha globin alleles is deemed to be genetically healthy. Someone with one nonfunctional alpha globin allele — whether it be HBA1 or HBA2 — is deemed to be a carrier. This means that they have the potential to have children who may become carriers themselves or may express the disease. And individual who has 2 nonfunctional alpha globin alleles is deemed to have thalassemia trait; these individuals make slightly lower amounts of hemoglobin and as such may present mild symptoms that are often associated with anemia which include shortness of breath, fainting and fatigue, angina and heart attacks, spleen enlargement, yellowing of the skin, and muscle pain. Those with 3 nonfunctioning alleles present hemoglobin H (Hb H) disease. There are 2 varieties of Hb H disease, Hb H disease in which hemoglobin is composed of 4 beta globin subunits and Hb H-Constant Spring (HCS) disease in which the alpha globin gene produces alpha globin subunits which are abnormally long.  individuals with Hb H disease express pronounced mild to moderate microcytic hypochromic hemolytic anemia and those with HCS express moderate to severe microcytic hypochromic hemolytic anemia. And lastly an absence or defect in all 4 alpha globin alleles is non compatible with life and leads to alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis which is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in two or more fetal compartments, including ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and skin edema (Kohne, 2011).</span>

Alpha thalassemias are particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions occurring in around 1 in 10 thousand people. Here we see the epidemiology of alpha thalassemias; the alpha plus-thalassaemias result from deletions of 3.7 kb or 4.2 kb, which remove a single α-globin gene. The alpha 0-thalassaemias result from deletions of both of the linked α-globin genes. As we can see, these mutations are present in up to 80% of populations in certain regions.</span>

            <span>As shown in figure 2, the production of beta chains is controlled by a single gene: the HBB gene and as such there are only two alleles which control the production of this globin. Malfunction of these genes causes beta thalassemia and three main forms have been described: thalassemia major also known as Cooley’s anemia which results from the absence or malfunction of both beta globin alleles, thalassemia intermedia which is the product of one nonfunctional or two malfunctional genes and thalassemia minor also known as thalassemia trait and makes individuals carriers. Individuals with thalassemia major usually present symptoms of severe anemia within the first two years of life with. Findings in untreated or poorly treated individuals with thalassemia major, as seen in some developing countries, are growth retardation, pallor, jaundice, poor musculature, hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, development of masses from extramedullary hematopoiesis, and skeletal changes that result from expansion of the bone marrow (Galanello, 2010).</span>

        <main>
            <p class="subSubTitle">Sickle Cell Disease</p>
            <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutant variety of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S which is produced when glutamic acid is substituted by a valine at the 6<sup>th</sup> amino acid of the beta globin chain. Clinically, there are 4 major pathobiological processes that have characterized sickle cell disease which are hemoglobin S polymerization, vaso-occlusion, hemolysis-mediated endothelial dysfunction, and sterile inflammation with vaso-occlusion leading to ischemia being the predominant pathophysiology responsible for acute systemic painful vaso-occlusive crisis and the requirement for emergency medical care by SCD patients. As patients with SCD live longer in high-income countries, the chronic impact of sustained hemolytic anemia and episodic vaso-occlusive events results in the progressive development of end-organ complications (Sundd, 2018). Vaso-occlusion and hemolysis-mediated endothelial dysfunction are caused by the polymerization of hemoglobin S. This polymerization occurs due to the valine substitution in the globin chain — because valine is hydrophobic, whereas glutamic acid is hydrophilic, this change makes the hemoglobin prone to abnormal aggregation. In areas of low oxygen this leads the hemoglobin to aggregate and give the red blood cell a sickle-like shape which in turn destabilizes the membrane of the cell leading to hemolysis and anemia, and leads to vaso-occlusion which can cause infarcts and end-organ complications. </p>

As with most hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease is predominantly prevalent in India, the Middle East, and Africa with some regions in Africa having a prevalence of hemoglobin S found in up to 19% of the population. In the United States sickle cell anemia affects about 100,000 individuals, most being of African ethnicity with 1 in 365 African Americans suffering from SCD.</span>

            <span>Treatments for sever thalassemias both alpha and beta and sickle cell disease involve frequent blood transfusions. Unfortunately, blood transfusions are often expensive, for example in 2013 one unit of blood cost about US $120 in Zimbabwe, which represents one eighth of the country’s GDP per capita (Hemez, 2016). Additionally — as seen in figure 8 — blood availability and safety are often poor in countries which have the highest incidence of hemoglobinopathies. Furthermore, frequent blood transfusions may lead to iron overload which can build up in the heart, liver, joints, pancreas, and pituitary gland if left untreated and may therefore cause organ damage, and lead to a heart attack, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, depression, and premature death (Kohne, 2011). Iron overload is a common complication affecting a quarter of the adult patients with SCD. And although iron overload may be treated with iron-chelator therapy, this is often even more expensive than blood transfusions, costing between $160,000-$220,000 per year in the USA (Master, 2016). These factors combined with the fact that hemoglobinopathies often affect individuals in low-income areas make treatment for severe hemoglobinopathies inaccessible. </span>
            <p>There are also symptomatic treatments which are used to treat the symptoms of sickle cell disease and anemia which include analgesics, antibiotics, ACE inhibitors and hydroxyurea which are significantly more affordable and less dangerous. But symptomatic treatment of severe hemoglobinopathies without providing blood transfusions and iron-chelation therapy may significantly reduce both quality of life and lifespan.</p>
            <p>It is possible to cure these conditions with stem cell or bone marrow transplants. Unfortunately — as will blood transfusions and iron-chelator therapy — these transplants often come with a high price tag. For example, in Europe and the USA hematopoietic stem cell transplants range from $30,000 to $88,000 for a single autologous transplantation to $200,000 or more for a matched unrelated myeloablative allogeneic procedure and in India — which has high rates of prevalence of hemoglobinopathies — an autologous transplant costs between $10,331 and $39,367 and an allogeneic transplant ranges between $10,832 to $44,701 (Sharma, 2014). Additionally, transplants come with significant pathological risks such as graft versus host disease — a condition that occurs when donor bone marrow or stem cells attack the recipient — if not performed with the proper level of care and technology, which is often inaccessible for those who need it most. Fortunately gene therapy has shown promising results for treatments which may be available to the public in the not so distant future.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Gene therapy is the treatment of disorders or disease through transfer of engineered genetic material into human cells. There are 2 ways of transferring genes to human cells, one way can be synthetically through polymers, and another way is to deliver it through modified viruses. It is desirable to use polymeric gene delivery as it is safer than transfer through viruses, it has low immunogenicity and toxicity, production and administration is generally easier, and there is no size limitation to the size of a DNA insert which can be transferred. But there are also disadvantages to polymeric gene delivery which have prevented it from being widely used in clinical trials. The major challenge is an insufficient gene transfer efficiency due to the need for post-uptake endosomal escape and nuclear translocation of the DNA complex, and with insufficient gene transfer the treatment is usually entirely ineffective (Scheller, 2009). On the other hand, we have viral vectors which — due to their higher rates of immunogenicity and difficulty of transfer — must have three universal requirements. They first must guarantee that the transfer is safe by being delivered through an immunologically inert vector. Second, they must protect the genetic material being transferred from degradation — as viral proteins may induce non-symptomatic immune responses which may degrade the vector and genetic material. And thirdly, the vector must encode an effective therapeutic gene that has sustained expression at the defined target site (Scheller, 2009). Adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and retroviruses have been used as viral vectors and for hemoglobinopathies lentiviruses — a type of retrovirus — has been the most efficient.</p>

            <p class="subSubTitle">Approaches</p>
            <p>As shown in figure 2, in humans 2 gene clusters direct the synthesis of hemoglobin: the alpha locus, which contains the embryonic zeta gene and two adult alpha genes; and the beta locus, which consists of the epsilon, gamma g, gamma a, delta and beta genes. In addition to the individual regulation of each globin gene by transcription factors, the transcription of the entire beta globin cluster is subjected to a shared control region indicated as locus control region (LCR), lying 40–60 kb upstream of the β-globin gene. With this observation the development of a lentivirus vector that included a β-globin cassette with a portion of the LCR, showed major breakthroughs and proved efficacious in correcting two models of β-thalassemia and SCD, which paved the way for clinical trials (Ikawa, 2019). </p>
            <p>Another strategy for gene therapy in SCD and β-thalassemia has been to increase the expression of fetal hemoglobin. It is known that the symptoms experienced by patients suffering from β-thalassemia and SCD are less severe symptoms when fetal hemoglobin is elevated due to the condition known as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) (Bunn, 1997). In β-thalassemia, elevated gamma-globin levels compensate for the β-globin deficiency, which improves the imbalance in the ratio of α to β-like globins and reduces the anemia-associated symptoms. The mechanisms of protective activity by HbF in SCD is that γ-globin chains are incorporated into mixed hemoglobin tetramers that do not participate in polymer formation. This inhibits sickling and leading to a less severe clinical phenotype. In SCD, HbF levels greater than 20% reduces severity of disease symptoms and improves patient survival (Ikawa, 2019). This approach has led to therapeutic expression of the endogenous γ-globin genes under the control of the LCR. To induce HbF, researchers have knocked down expression of B cell CLL/lymphoma 11A protein (BCL11A), a protein which greatly regulates expression of HbF as it has been shown that patients with BCL11A haploinsufficiency have increased levels of HbF (Funnell, 2015). Several trials have succeeded in the functional correction of thalassemic and SCD CD34+ cells in vitro and in vivo by inactivation of the BCL11A-erythroid enhancer which would shows promise in the treatment of hemoglobinopathies. </p>

            <span>There are currently over 12 clinical trials using gene therapy which aim at treating and curing hemoglobinopathies. For beta thalassemia observations from the clinical trials of the LentiGlobin BB305 vector showed that 11 out of 13 patients who had a non-β0/0 genotype were able to completely discontinue blood transfusions. In trial NCT02453477, transfusion requirement was reduced in the three adult patients with severe β0/IVS110 genotype, and three of the four pediatric patients became transfusion independent. Unfortunately, treatment for the phenotype of β-thalassemia major (β0/0) has been met with greater challenges. Despite this, positive results observed in the less sever phenotypical expressions of β-thalassemia patients encouraged trials to extend gene therapy to SCD. A patient treated in France with the BB305 LV achieved a level of therapeutic anti-sickling globin of ~50% with pathobiological parameters typical of SCD carriers. In another current gene therapy trial, the fetal hemoglobin induction strategy is based on introduction of short hairpin RNA for the purpose of increasing γ-globin and reducing mutant βS globin expression. In this trial, three months after transplantation, the first patient treated showed a significant level of HbF, accounting for 23% of total Hb and 60% of RBCs expressed HbF (Kunz, 2019). </span>
            <p class="subSubTitle">Future challenges</p>
            <p>Although clinical trials have shown successful outcomes, the high cost of current ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy is one of the major barriers to a widespread application of gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies. To give a broad idea, gene therapy treatment in the USA ranges from $373,000 to $2.1M excluding costs of complications and additional medications associated with the treatment (Carr, 2016). The main reason gene therapy treatment for hemoglobinopathies remains high is due to the fact that large amounts of GMP vector are required to properly convert hematopoietic stem cells into patients. Additionally, another challenge that comes with the use of gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies is the toxicity involved in the translocation of hematopoietic stem cells. Currently, in order to create space in bone marrow for the transduced hematopoietic stem cells complete myeloablative regimens are used. These treatments carry high risks of toxicity in the early stages of treatment and secondary effects later on. These regimens also come with high costs as they often require high levels of initial support as patients often require several blood transfusions, prophylactic infection treatments, and hospitalization all of which come at high costs (Ikawa, 2019). </p>

            <p class="subTitle">Conclusion</p>
            <p>Hemoglobinopathies are some of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in the world and occur at high rates in impoverished countries where access to medical treatment is often limited or non-existent altogether. The symptoms associated with the most prevalent hemoglobinopathies are anemia induced which make physical labor an everyday struggle. This is particularly difficult for individuals in impoverished countries where significant percentages of the economy revolve around industries which require arduous physical labor. Even if medical facilities are accessible to those who have these conditions, the current costs associated with treating them are inaccessible and reducing these costs significantly is improbable. Fortunately, gene therapy trials — although still in early stages — have shown show significant promise. The major barriers to a widespread application of gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies are the high costs and toxic effects which come with transduction and delivery of hematopoietic stem cells. Auspiciously, there are potential solutions to these problems. Currently large numbers of lentiviral preparation bring up the costs, but recently a trial has described a stable producer cell line which could substantially reduce costs. Genome-editing based strategies have also shown promise in reducing costs (Ikawa, 2019). Another approach that has been brough forward is the use of monoclonal antibodies to target CD45 and CD117 on hematopoietic stem cells, therefore eliminating the need for complete myeloablative regimens and hence reducing the high costs and cytotoxic effects associated with severe myelosuppression (Kunz, 2020). Additional funding for trials and studies is needed to advance the technology to improve outcomes and address these issues. And even though trials are in early stages, several solutions to bring down costs have been proven successful. This indicates that if trials continue to be performed at the rate they have been for the past years, solutions and alternatives will be found which will likely drive down the prices and risks exponentially in the following years, making gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies a viable cure for those who need it most in the not-so distant future. </p>

                Mauricio was born and raised in Mexico City. He is a current undergraduate student at Washington University in St. Louis majoring in computer science and is on the pre-nursing track. He will be attending Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing starting in August of 2021 and will be pursuing his master of science in nursing. Having grown up in a developing country with a huge wealth gap and therefore incredibly unequal access to healthcare, he has always been passionate about finding ways to deliver healthcare to the most vulnerable populations. As such, he is looking to work with international humanitarian medical organizations such as Médecins sans frontières (Doctors without borders). Additionally he is interested in medical research and breakthroughs which look into treating or curing conditions for populations which have long been ignored by the medical community. These conditions are generally genetic and endemic and affect populations in impovrished countries.
