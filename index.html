            <p>Hemoglobin is the iron-containing oxygen-transport protein in the red blood cells. Hemoglobin in blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body where it releases the oxygen to permit aerobic respiration and carries carbon dioxide — a byproduct of metabolism — back to the lungs to be excreted. Hemoglobin is a tetramer, meaning it consists of 4 protein subunits called the globin molecules. In humans there are 3 types of hemoglobin: HbA which is formed by 2 alpha and 2 beta globins and constitutes 95% to 98% of total hemoglobin in healthy adults, HbA2 which is formed by 2 alpha and 2 delta globins and constitutes 2-3% of total hemoglobin in healthy adults, and HbF or fetal hemoglobin which is formed by 2 alpha and 2 gamma globins and is the main type of hemoglobin found in fetuses and newborns with trace amounts found in healthy adults. </p>

                <span>The α globin subunits are encoded by two genes on chromosome 16 known as the HBA1 and HBA2 genes, and the β, γ, and δ globin subunits are encoded on chromosome 11, with the β globin being encoded by gene HBB, the δ globin being encoded by the HBD gene, and the γ globin being encoded by 2 genes: HBG1 and HBG2. The absence or defect of these genes — particularly the genes controlling for the α and β subunits, as they are the primary subunits in the overwhelming majority of hemoglobin in healthy adults — leads to hemoglobinopathies. </span>

            <span>As noted previously and as shown in figure 2, the production of α-globin is controlled by the four alleles of HBA1 and HBA2 and changes in these genes cause α-thalassemia. Someone having 4 functional alpha globin alleles is deemed to be genetically healthy. Someone with one nonfunctional alpha globin allele — whether it be HBA1 or HBA2 — is deemed to be a carrier. This means that they have the potential to have children who may become carriers themselves or may express the disease. And individual who has 2 nonfunctional alpha globin alleles is deemed to have thalassemia trait; these individuals make slightly lower amounts of hemoglobin and as such may present mild symptoms that are often associated with anemia which include shortness of breath, fainting and fatigue, angina and heart attacks, spleen enlargement, yellowing of the skin, and muscle pain. Those with 3 nonfunctioning alleles present hemoglobin H (Hb H) disease. There are 2 varieties of Hb H disease, Hb H disease in which hemoglobin is composed of 4 beta globin subunits and Hb H-Constant Spring (HCS) disease in which the alpha globin gene produces alpha globin subunits which are abnormally long.  individuals with Hb H disease express pronounced mild to moderate microcytic hypochromic hemolytic anemia and those with HCS express moderate to severe microcytic hypochromic hemolytic anemia. And lastly an absence or defect in all 4 alpha globin alleles is non compatible with life and leads to alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis which is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in two or more fetal compartments, including ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and skin edema.</span>

            <span>As with most genetic diseases hemoglobinopathies are often endemic and associated with specific geographic areas. Alpha thalassemias are particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions occurring in around 1 in 10 thousand people. Here we see the epidemiology of alpha thalassemias; the alpha plus-thalassaemias result from deletions of 3.7 kb or 4.2 kb, which remove a single α-globin gene. The alpha 0-thalassaemias result from deletions of both of the linked α-globin genes. As we can see, these mutations are present in up to 80% of populations in certain regions.</span>

            <span>As shown in figure 2, the production of beta chains is controlled by a single gene: the HBB gene and as such there are only two alleles which control the production of this globin. Malfunction of these genes causes beta thalassemia and three main forms have been described: thalassemia major also known as Cooley’s anemia which results from the absence or malfunction of both beta globin alleles, thalassemia intermedia which is the product of one nonfunctional or two malfunctional genes and thalassemia minor also known as thalassemia trait and makes individuals carriers. Individuals with thalassemia major usually present symptoms of severe anemia within the first two years of life with. Findings in untreated or poorly treated individuals with thalassemia major, as seen in some developing countries, are growth retardation, pallor, jaundice, poor musculature, hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, development of masses from extramedullary hematopoiesis, and skeletal changes that result from expansion of the bone marrow.</span>
